Sure, here's a simple homemade "Take 5" candy bar recipe. Please note that it requires some experience with baking, particularly with handling chocolate.

Ingredients:

- 1 cup creamy peanut butter
- 2 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups milk chocolate chips
- 1 1/2 cups pretzels, crushed
- 1 cup caramel bits
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1/2 cup roasted, salted peanuts, chopped

Steps:

1. In a bowl, mix together the peanut butter, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until well combined. Set aside.

2. Melt half of the milk chocolate chips either in the microwave (in 30-second intervals) or in a double boiler. Spread the melted chocolate in the bottom of a lined 9x9-inch baking dish. Sprinkle half of the crushed pretzels on top.

3. Spread the peanut butter mixture on top of the pretzels. Place in the freezer for about 10 minutes to set.

4. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the caramel bits and heavy cream in 30-second intervals, stirring each time until fully melted and combined. Pour this caramel layer on top of the peanut butter layer. Sprinkle the chopped peanuts on top, and then place back in the freezer for another 10 minutes to set.

5. Melt the remaining chocolate chips, and spread this over the caramel and peanut layer. Sprinkle the remaining crushed pretzels on top.

6. Refrigerate for at least an hour, or until fully set. Cut into bars and serve. 

Remember to store these in a cool place, as they can get quite messy if they warm up! Enjoy your homemade Take 5 bars!

Do the pretzels have seed oils? 

## ASSISTANT
Many commercially produced pretzels do contain seed oils such as canola, sunflower, or soybean oil. However, you can find pretzels that are made without seed oils by checking the ingredients on the package. Alternatively, you can make your own pretzels at home without seed oils. 

Here is a basic homemade pretzel recipe without seed oils:

Ingredients:

- 1 and 1/2 cups warm water (110°F-115°F)
- 1 teaspoon active dry or instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
- 4 to 4.5 cups all-purpose flour
- Coarse sea salt for sprinkling
- 1 large egg, beaten (for egg wash)

Instructions:

1. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Stir with a spoon until fairly mixed, about 1 minute.

2. Add salt and sugar; stir until fairly combined. Slowly add 3 cups of flour, 1 cup at a time. Mix with a wooden spoon until dough is thick.

3. Add 3/4 cup more flour until the dough is no longer sticky. If it's still sticky, add up to 1/2 cup more.

4. Once the dough is formed, knead for about 3 minutes and shape into a ball.

5. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Set aside.

6. With a sharp knife, cut the ball of dough into 1/3 cup sections. Roll the dough into a long rope, about 20-22 inches long. Take the ends and draw them together so the dough forms a circle. Twist the ends, then bring them towards yourself and press them down into a pretzel shape.

7. In a small bowl, beat the egg and pour into a shallow bowl or pie dish. Dunk the shaped pretzel into the egg wash (both sides). Place on baking sheet and sprinkle with coarse sea salt.

8. Bake for 10 minutes at 425°F (220°C), turn the oven to broil, and bake for 5 more minutes to brown the tops. Watch closely to prevent burning.

You can use these homemade pretzels in the Take 5 recipe in place of store-bought pretzels. Enjoy!
