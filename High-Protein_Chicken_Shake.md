**High-Protein Chicken Shake**

**Ingredients:**

- 6 oz of cooked chicken breast
- 1 cup of chicken broth
- 1 medium potato, cooked
- Optional: 1 tablespoon of beef tallow

**Instructions:**

1. To cook the chicken breast, place it in a large pot and add enough water (or chicken broth for extra flavor) to cover the chicken by an inch. Slowly heat the water to a gentle simmer and let the chicken simmer until it's cooked through, which is usually about 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken pieces. Check for doneness by ensuring a meat thermometer reads 165°F (74°C) when inserted into the thickest part of the breast. Let it cool before adding to the blender.

2. To cook the potato, peel it and cut it into roughly 1-inch pieces. Place the pieces in a pot and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, usually 10-20 minutes depending on the size of the pieces. Drain well and let cool before adding to the blender.

3. In a blender, combine the cooled cooked chicken, potato, and chicken broth. Add the beef tallow if using. Blend until smooth. If the consistency is too thick, add more chicken broth or a little bit of water.

4. Distribute the shake evenly into airtight containers or mason jars with secure lids. Store the containers in the refrigerator immediately after filling them. The shake should be safe to consume for up to 3-4 days if kept continuously refrigerated.

**Serving Instructions:**

When you're ready to have a serving, take one container out of the fridge. If you prefer it warm, transfer the shake to a microwave-safe container or a pot if you're heating it on the stove. Heat it up until it reaches your desired temperature. Stir well before consuming. If you prefer it cold, you can consume it directly from the fridge.
