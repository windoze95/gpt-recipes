# Seed oil free recipes, generated using GPT-4.

Current dietary patterns often favor omega-6 fatty acids, found in high amounts in seed and vegetable oils and soy. These can promote inflammation when consumed in excess relative to omega-3 fatty acids. This project focuses on generating recipes that aim to rebalance this skewed ratio by promoting foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known for their anti-inflammatory properties.

## Why These Diet Preferences?

The balance of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids in our diet is crucial for overall health. However, it's not just about the quantity, but also about the type of omega-3 fatty acids consumed.

- **Omega-6 Fatty Acids**: Found abundantly in seed and vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and poultry. While essential, a disproportionately high intake of omega-6 relative to omega-3 may promote inflammation and potentially impact hormonal balance, including testosterone levels. Certain omega-6 fatty acids like linoleic acid, while necessary for our bodies, are consumed in excess and could contribute to health issues when not balanced with omega-3 intake.

- **Soy**: Although soy is a common source of plant-based protein, it contains high amounts of omega-6 and isoflavones, which with excessive consumption can affect hormone regulation.

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA)**: Found in many plant-based foods, ALA is a precursor to EPA and DHA. However, the conversion process in the body is inefficient, making foods high in ALA less optimal as primary omega-3 sources.

- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA)**: These are the most effective forms of omega-3. They are found primarily in fatty fish and algaeðŸ¤¢

- **Grass-fed Beef**: This is a preferred source of protein for our recipes. Grass-fed beef not only has a better omega-6 to omega-3 ratio compared to grain-fed beef but also contains higher amounts of other beneficial nutrients like conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and antioxidants.

## Why GPT-4?

GPT-4 is a powerful language model capable of generating diverse, creative, and adaptable recipes. It provides an innovative way to explore nutrition, emphasizing healthier dietary fats and offering delicious alternatives that adhere to these principles.

## My List

I've compiled a list of some common foods and oils, ordered from 'best' to 'worst' based on research conducted and after working with ChatGPT to factor in weighting based on overall health contribution and nutritional efficiency. While the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio, the omega-6 and omega-3 content, and the type of omega-3s are important factors, they are not the only elements that determine the nutritional value of a food. Different foods provide a variety of other nutrients that also contribute to a healthy diet. It's also important to note that even though certain foods like coconut oil may be low on this list due to their lack of omega-3 fatty acids, they can still have a place in a balanced diet due to their unique health properties, such as the presence of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) in coconut oil. Always consider your overall diet and lifestyle when choosing what foods to eat.
