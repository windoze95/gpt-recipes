Give me the best salmon recipe on a smoker. 

## ASSISTANT
Sure, here's a recipe for smoked salmon that you might enjoy:

Ingredients:
1. 1 whole salmon fillet (about 2 pounds)
2. 1/4 cup of brown sugar
3. 1/4 cup of kosher salt
4. 1 tablespoon of cracked black pepper
5. 2 teaspoons of dill
6. Lemon slices and fresh herbs for garnish

Brine:
1. In a bowl, mix together the brown sugar, salt, black pepper, and dill. 
2. Place the salmon fillet in a dish or zip-top bag, then rub the mixture all over the salmon. 
3. Cover or seal, then refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for a stronger flavor.

Smoking the Salmon:
1. Preheat your smoker to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Use a mild wood like alder or fruitwood for smoking.
2. Rinse the brine off the salmon under cold water and pat dry. Let the salmon sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes until it forms a shiny skin, known as a pellicle. This helps the smoke to adhere to the fish.
3. Place the salmon skin side down on the smoker. Cook until the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), which usually takes about an hour depending on the thickness of the fillet.
4. Remove the salmon from the smoker and let it rest for 10 minutes before serving. Garnish with lemon slices and fresh herbs if desired.

Enjoy your delicious smoked salmon!
